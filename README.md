# Tournament-Bracket-Maker
This will take a list of names and organize them into an orderly tournament.

I wrote this code to be able to create an easy and quick tournament bracket for any type of game that could use it. It takes the names into a list and creates another list that has the range of numbers from 1 to the length of the name list. It will then take these 2 lists and randomly assign a number to a name and place the combination into a dictionary called brackets. Then it will take this dictionary and order it into another dictionary from least to greatest key value because I want it to print out in order on the resulting page.

Future plans: I want to make the output page have boxes and the conntecting lines that a normal bracket would look like.
I also want to have the program to create a multiplayer battle situation instead of just 1 v 1 battle.
Eventually it would be fun to add in a GUI element and make it more user friendly, especially in adding the names to the tournament list.
